def make_multiwave_envelope(kpoints: jnp.ndarray) -> envelopes.Envelope:
  """Returns an oscillatory envelope.

  Envelope consists of a sum of truncated 3D Fourier series, one centered on
  each atom, with Fourier frequencies given by kpoints:

    sigma_{2i}*cos(kpoints_i.r_{ae}) + sigma_{2i+1}*sin(kpoints_i.r_{ae})

  Initialization sets the coefficient of the first term in each
  series to 1, and all other coefficients to 0. This corresponds to the
  cosine of the first entry in kpoints. If this is [0, 0, 0], the envelope
  will evaluate to unity at the beginning of training.

  Args:
    kpoints: Reciprocal lattice vectors of terms included in the Fourier
      series. Shape (nkpoints, ndim) (Note that ndim=3 is currently
      a hard-coded default).
